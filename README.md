# cryoBioEN
Addition to the BioEN, which allows to incorporate cryoEM data into reweighting
This is a branch of the main code, which is dedicated to run fitting of NC ensemble of 100 structures
obtained from MD simulations of FLN5 into map generated from these structures with different setup. We generated 100 density maps by randomly selecting 10 structures and then generating avg. density map. List of 10 random structures we get from pre-generated file: random_list.dat. We use the same list of selected models in order to have comparable set of maps.
